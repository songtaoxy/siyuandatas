A **definition** is a statement of the meaning of a term (a [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word "Word"), [phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase "Phrase"), or other set of [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol")).^[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition#cite_note-1)^ ^[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition#cite_note-2)^ Definitions can be classified into two large categories, [intensional definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensional_definition "Intensional definition")[((20210410112558-bagta4y "{{.text}}")) ](which try to give the sense of a term) and [extensional definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_definition "Extensional definition")  (which try to list the objects that a term describes).^[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition#cite_note-Lyons-3)^ Another important category of definitions is the class of [ostensive definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostensive_definition "Ostensive definition"), which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.^[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition#cite_note-4)^ ^[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition#cite_note-5)^
